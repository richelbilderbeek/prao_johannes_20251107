For me prao is about learning about a job and what it's like to have that job and getting work experience before actually starting to work.
The goal of prao is to experience the job and see if it interests you and to know better what is expected at a younger age.
The person who i thought succeeded with this the most was either Elisabeth or Jerker. Elisabeth told us about her job as a boss and about teaching PhD students and about the systems and some scince she had studied.
Jerker had us work down at the cluster removing old GPU's from the computers, i think he did a good job at showing us the practical side and working with the computer cluster.

For me prao is about learning about a job and what it's like to have that job and getting work experience before actually starting to work.
The goal of prao is to experience the job and see if it interests you and to know better what is expected at a younger age.
The person who i thought succeeded with this the most was either Elisabeth or Jerker. Elisabeth told us about her job as a boss and about teaching PhD students and about the systems and some science she had studied.
Jerker had us work down at the cluster removing old GPU's from the computers, i think he did a good job at showing us the practical side and working with the computer cluster.

For 1 and 2 i think you could add some more illustation to make them less bland and help differenciate the different parts. I like that there is a summary at the end of the first one and i think the other two could also use a summary to make it simpler to remind yourself without having to read the whole thing all over again. Also i think they should go deeper into what you are expected to learn in the learning outcomes for all of them and maybe add some learning outcomes for 1. Not really needed but it could be a good idea to add some more difficult problems for those who are ahead to solve
## 1
Add some illustrations, add more learning outcomes and explain deeper what you will learn
## 2
Add some illustrations, add a summary,  explain deeper in the outcomes.
## 3
Add summary, explain further in the outcomes 
I have tried using chatgpt and googling advice but i have not found a solution yet.

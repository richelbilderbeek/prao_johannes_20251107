# Reflection

The goal of a reflection is to improve.

One does so writing down how a passed day went:
what did yo do, how did it go and how can it be improved?

By forcing oneself to think of this, one can actually learn from the past.

## What did you do?
I wrote about what the goal of prao is and who at uppmax was best at reaching that goal. I wrote feedback on courses. I tried to code something that could be useful to scientists with a runtime speed profile that detected a runtime speed bottleneck somewhere. And write a report about that assignment

## What did you do well?
I tried my best and completed the first 2 assignments


## What could be improved?
I could have looked harder to find more feedback on the courses and found a solution for the last assignment

## What did your supervisor do well?
He was good at explaining what we were supposed to do and give help on the assignments. 

## How can your supervisor be improved?
Maybe write a bit simpler exercises than the last one that require less time to fit in one day.

## What would you do differently next time?
come in to the last assignment more prepared, for example picking out a subject before starting it

## Which tip would you give to future PRAO students?
Take time to think through and plan the assignments beforehand so you have more time to spend writing and doing the assignment

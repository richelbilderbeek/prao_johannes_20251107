# Reflection from supervisor

## What I did well

I think I treated Johannes and his other PRAO equally.
They were given actual jobs and I used their output directly.
I let them both know that I used their works.
I am happy about the last project: none have finished it, but it
does make one feel how it is to work at my workplace. 

## What I could do better

The start of the day was a bit sloppy:
one PRAO was late without a good reason
and the other was late with a good reason.
This means I had to badly introduce myself
to the first PRAO, until I would do this
properly with both of them present.
I need to think more about how to deal with two PRAOs
arriving at different times.

## My conclusion about my PRAO

Johannes did a good job:

- he is focused
- he is polite
- he seems organized in his head:
  in the second assignment, rating course material,
  he had a clear structure
- he is creative:
  he had ideas on how to handle the harder/third assignment

What could be even better:

- he was late: I hope next time he visits a new/unknown place
  that he'll leave earlier
- his work on the harder/third assignment was lost:
  I hope he'll commit more often next time

All in all, I would certainly recommend having Johannes as a PRAO.
